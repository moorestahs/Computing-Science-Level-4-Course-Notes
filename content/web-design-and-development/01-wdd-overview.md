The web is everywhere. We're used to browsing the web using a web browser to view web sites but the technologies that are used to create web pages can be found in other places such as the apps on our phones and tablets.

## HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The main language that is used to create web pages is HTML (HyperText Markup Language). It is joined by CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which is used for appearance and layout, and JavaScript which is used to add more interactive elements.

## Web Design and Development

Web design and development usually takes place between a client and a developer.

### Client

The client is the person who needs a website. People of all types might need a website but a common occurrence is that this person is a business owner who would like a website to enhance their business. The client knows a lot about their business and what they want, but they probably do not know much about web development.

### Developer

The developer is the person who will build a website. They will work with the client to help them get the website the want. The developer will be an expert in creating websites but they won't likely know much about the client's area of business.

### Analysis

The first part of creating a website is for the developer to analyse what the client actually needs. This can involve a lot of discussion - it is really important that the developer fully understands what they have to do before they actually start building the website.
