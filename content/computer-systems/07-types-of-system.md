There are many types of computer system. Here are the most common:

## Wearable

Usually a watch or fitness band. The watch will often have a touch screen and several sensors to detect motion and other health related aspects such as heart rate. The output is a small screen, perhaps with a small speaker too. Backing storage will consist of a 1 Gb (approx.) solid state drive.

## Phone

Phones or smartphones can be very powerful pocket sized computers. The key characteristics are:

+ Pocket sized
+ Touch screen input
+ Smaller amounts of memory and backing storage compared to laptops and desktops
+ Very portable

## Tablet

Tablets fit somewhere between phones and laptops. They are often used for entertainment but can increasingly be something that people can do work on.

+ Large screen
+ Touch screen input
+ Smaller amounts of memory and backing storage compared to laptops and desktops
+ Portable

## Laptop 

Laptops aim to take the power of a desktop computer and make it more portable.

+ Large screen
+ Input devices include keyboard and touch-pad
+ Portable

##Â Desktop

Desktops are the standard "computer". They are designed mostly for work purposes and the key characteristics are:

+ A wide range of input and output devices
+ Powerful processors
+ Large amounts of memory and backing storage


## Server

A server provides __services__ to users. These services can include:

+ Messaging and email
+ Music and video streaming
+ Online gaming
+ Cloud storage
+ Collaborative applications

Servers are generally placed in data centres along with hundreds of other servers.

## SuperComputer

A supercomputer is a very powerful computer aim at solving very specific types of tasks that require a lot of computational power.

The types of problems that supercomputers are used for include:

+ quantum mechanics
+ weather forecasting
+ climate research
+ oil and gas exploration
+ molecular modeling
+ physical simulations (such as simulations of the early moments of the universe)

The [Top500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500) project ranks the most powerful supercomputers. The most powerful supercomputer in the world just now is Fugaku in Japan.
