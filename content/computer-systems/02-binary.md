The language of computers is binary. Computers only understand binary because at the smallest level they are made of on/off switches called __transistors__.

If the transistor is off (no electrical current) then this represents the number 0 and if it is on then this represents 1.

Converting a number from binary to decimal is easy. At Primary school you learned that the position of a digit in a number affects its value.
