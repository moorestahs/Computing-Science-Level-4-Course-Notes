The purpose of output devices is to allow for the results of the processing done by the computer to be seen or heard. Here are some common output devices.

## Laser Printer

This works by using a laser beam and toner to put the image of a page onto the paper.  They are very fast and produce very high-quality output.  However, they can be more expensive to buy than an inkjet.

Inkjets spray ink onto paper to produce high-quality documents.  They are slower than lasers but cost a lot less to buy.  The cost of ink cartridges can be quite high.
