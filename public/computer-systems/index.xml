      <title>Computer Systems Overview</title>

      <description>A computer system can be represented using the diagram below.
The components of the computer system are:
Input Devices The purpose of input devices is to put data into the computer. This data could be instructions via the keyboard, cursor movements via the mouse or sound data from a microphone.
Output Devices The purpose of output devices is to see or hear the results of the processing the computer has done.</description>

      <title>Binary</title>
      <link>https://cs4.staugustinesrchs.uk/computer-systems/02-binary/</link>

      <description>The language of computers is binary. Computers only understand binary because at the smallest level they are made of on/off switches called transistors.
If the transistor is off (no electrical current) then this represents the number 0 and if it is on then this represents 1.
Converting to Binary Converting a number from binary to decimal is easy. At Primary school you learned that the position of a digit in a number affects its value.</description>

      <title>Input Devices</title>

      <description>The purpose of input devices is to allow for the input of instructions or data into the computer. Here are some common input devices.
Keyboard A keyboard is used to enter text or commands into the computer. The keyboard has the usual QWERTY keys plus special command function keys.
Mouse You move the mouse and click the mouse buttons to control the cursor on the screen and to select icons and menus.</description>

      <description>The purpose of output devices is to allow for the results of the processing done by the computer to be seen or heard. Here are some common output devices.
Laser Printer This works by using a laser beam and toner to put the image of a page onto the paper. They are very fast and produce very high-quality output. However, they can be more expensive to buy than an inkjet.</description>

      <title>Backing Storage</title>

      <description>Units of Storage When we store digital data, it is all stored as binary. The amount of data can be represented using different units. The smallest unit is a bit (0 or 1) and one of the largest units is a petabyte (there are actually bigger units - try researching what they are).
Backing Storage Devices The purpose of backing storage devices is to save data when it isn&amp;rsquo;t required by the processor - this includes when the computer is switched off.</description>

      <title>The Processor and Memory</title>

      <description>The Processor The processor, sometimes known as the central processing unit (CPU), is the part of a computer system that carries out the instructions of a computer program, to perform the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of the system. It is sometimes known as the brains of the computer.
The processor is divided into three parts :
  The Arithmetic and Logic Unit(ALU) performs all the calculations (e.g. + - / *) and Logical operations (e.</description>

      <title>Types of Computer System</title>
      <link>https://cs4.staugustinesrchs.uk/computer-systems/07-types-of-system/</link>

      <description>There are many types of computer system. Here are the most common:
Wearable Usually a watch or fitness band. The watch will often have a touch screen and several sensors to detect motion and other health related aspects such as heart rate. The output is a small screen, perhaps with a small speaker too. Backing storage will consist of a 1 Gb (approx.) solid state drive.
Phone Phones or smartphones can be very powerful pocket sized computers.</description>

      <description>Bit-mapped Graphics This is the type of graphic that can be created using a paint application.
A bit-mapped graphic is stored as a 2-dimensional array of pixels where each pixel stores the colour of that pixel. Normally you don&amp;rsquo;t see the pixels as you only look at the overall picture.
Look at the illustration below. In the normal view of the dog (left) it is hard to see the individual pixels, but if the image is zoomed in (right) the pixels become more obvious.</description>
