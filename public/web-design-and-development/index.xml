      <description>The web is everywhere. We&amp;rsquo;re used to browsing the web using a web browser to view web sites but the technologies that are used to create web pages can be found in other places such as the apps on our phones and tablets.
HTML, CSS and JavaScript The main language that is used to create web pages is HTML (HyperText Markup Language). It is joined by CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which is used for appearance and layout, and JavaScript which is used to add more interactive elements.</description>

      <description>HTML consists of tags. There are about 100 tags that make up HTML but you don&amp;rsquo;t need to remember all of them to create websites - most websites are created with a much smaller number of tags.
Tags The majority of tags have an opening part and a closing part. The tags themselves are written inside angled brackets &amp;lt; &amp;gt;. For example the heading 1 tag which produces the largest text is called h1 and it&amp;rsquo;s opening tag is &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;.</description>

      <description>The HTML in a web page follows a basic structure.
The &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; tag is the first tag in the page and the closing tag is the last tag.
The &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; tag generally appears next and contains information about our page. In our practical tasks we place the &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;link&amp;gt; tags here to set the page title and link to the external stylesheet respectively.
The &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; tag is where the main page content goes.</description>

      <description>CSS allows us to style our web page. There are three places where we can write CSS:
 In an external CSS file In an internal style block within the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; Inline, as an attribute of a tag  CSS Syntax CSS uses a different syntax to HTML. Syntax means the &amp;lsquo;rules of the language&amp;rsquo;.
CSS is really just a list of rules that will apply to our HTML. The rules will can do things such as:</description>
